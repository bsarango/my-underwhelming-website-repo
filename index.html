            <p>I've embarked on a journey to explore food that I wish to each and food that I've never tried before with suggestions from my friends from the time restaurants began to open up during the COVID quarintine till now.</p>
            <p>The Restaurants displayed come from a diversity of cultures and are inspired from the cultures
                shared to me by friends, peers, colleauges, and family friends. I've been highly inspired and motivated by 
                many YouTube channels (and Shows) such as 'Food Ranger', 'ATE'(Worth It), 'BuzzFeed', and 'Munchies' to go
                explore and try food on my own. Here's just a small list of cuisine's I've tried on my own.
            </div>   
                <p class="cuisine">South American - Peruvian, Venezuelan, Brazilian, Guyanese, Colombian, and Ecuadorean Food</p> 
                <p class="cuisine">Central American - Mexican, Salvadorean, Panamanian, Guatemalen Food</p>
                <p class="cuisine">Spanish Carribean - Puerto Rican, Dominincan Food</p>
                <p class="cuisine">Carribean - Jamaican, Trinidadian, Grenadian, Haitian</p>
                <p class="cuisine">East Asian - Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Japanese</p>
                <p class="cuisine">South Asian - Indian, Pakistani, Bengali</p>
                <p class="cuisine">Middle Eastern - Turkish, Israeli, Persian</p>
            </div> I highly recommend these places to anyone in the local areas, looking for a good experience, a modern take, and not wanting to break their bank!</p>
