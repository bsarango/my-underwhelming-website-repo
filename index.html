            <p>The Restaurants displayed come from a diversity of cultures and are inspired from the cultures
                shared to me by friends, peers, colleauges, and family friends. I've been highly inspired and motivated by 
                many YouTube channels (and Shows) such as 'Food Ranger', 'ATE'(Worth It), 'BuzzFeed', and 'Munchies' to go
                explore and try food on my own. Here's just a small list of cuisine's I've tried on my own.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Peruvian, Venezuelan, Brazilian, Guyanese, Colombian, and Ecuadorean Food - South American</li>
                <li>Mexican, Salvadorean, Panamanian, Guatemalen Food- Central American</li>
                <li>Puerto Rican, Dominincan Food - Spanish Carribean</li>
                <li>Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Japanese - Southeast Asian Food</li>
            </ul>
            <p> I highly recommend these places to anyone in the local areas, looking for a good experience, a modern take, and not wanting to break their bank!</p>
